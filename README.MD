# DL and ML files

In this folder I upload anything related with deep learning and machine learning. 

## Coursera and Udacity projects

Coursera and Udacity projects are uploaded in their corresponding folders:

* [Coursera](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/tree/master/Coursera/dl)
* [Udacity](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/tree/master/Udacity)

Coursera and Udacity usually provide the skeleton and let the students complete it.
I think those courses were a good introduction in DL.

Official websites: 

* [Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)
* [Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)


## Kaggle

I also use to play around in [Kaggle](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/tree/master/Kaggle) competitions.

## Meetups

I upload notebooks from hands-on meetups from the group [Machine Learning Tokyo](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/).
