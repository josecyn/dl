# Udacity projects

In this nanodegree program, students implement 5 main projects. 
Udacity provides the **skeleton** for those projects as some functions. 
The **key parts** are implemented by the students.

## [Project 5: Face Generation](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/blob/master/Udacity/project5)

Using CIFAR-10 we generated similar images and using celebA we did face generation using **GAN architecture**.
