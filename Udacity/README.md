# Udacity projects

In this nanodegree program, students implement 5 main projects. 
Udacity provides the **skeleton** for those projects as some functions. 
The **key parts** are implemented by the students.

## [Project 1](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/tree/master/Udacity/project1)

First implementation from scratch of a shallow neural network to predict daily rental bike.

## [Project 2](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/tree/master/Udacity/project2)

Image classification project from scratch using Tensorflow api. 

## [Project 3](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/tree/master/Udacity/project3)

TV Script generation using word embedding and RNN architecture.

## [Project 4](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/blob/master/Udacity/project4)

Language translation from english to french using RNN architecture. 

## [Project 5](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/blob/master/Udacity/project5)

Using CIFAR-10 we generated similar images and using celebA we did face generation using **GAN architecture**.
