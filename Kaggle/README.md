# Kaggle projects

In this folder I have the Kaggle and Signate projects I play with.

Most of them are image recognition projects using Keras and Tensorflow: 

* __DogsVsCats__: try to identify dogs and cats. I did this project using very few data and using image augmentation.

* __TC / nonTC__: Tropical storm or not? Binary classification using once again very few data. TIF files made me develop my own keras generator.

* __iMaterialize__: multiclass classification identify objects among 128 classes. The organisation only provided the links to images. For that reason, I decided to download just a few for each class and used image augmentation. 


In the **Taxi Fare** the goal is to predict the price of the taxi ride. 
I implemented this project using XGBoost. 
I focused on creating some new features. For example: is the taxi trip from or to the airport?
