## Projects

Coursera provides the **skeleton** and some of the functions needed for the project.
**Key parts** of the project are implemented by the students.

### Course 1 [Neural Networks and Deep Learning introduction](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/tree/master/Coursera/dl/Course1%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20DL):

In the projects of this course we focused on learning the basics of neural networks.
I implemented from scratch simple logistic regression and a simple shallow neural network.

### Course 2 [Improving Neural Networks](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/tree/master/Coursera/dl/Course2%20-%20Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks):

In the projects of this course, we focused on optimization methods and regularization techniques.
We were also introduced to Tensorflow basics.

### Course 3 Structuring ML projects

There were no projects in this course. The focus was on managing machine learning projects properly.
For example, the importance of building a good training/evaluation dataset so the model can generalize well.

### Course 4 [CNN architectures](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/tree/master/Coursera/dl/Course4%20-%20CNN):

One of the parts I enjoyed the most: Computer vision using CNN architectures.
In this course we were introduced to the CNN architecture and implemented it from scratch.
Afterwards we used Keras to implement it.
I also implemented the ResNet architecture and the YOLO algorithm based on the paper.
On 4th week I did face verification / recognition and style transfer learning.

### Course 5 [RNN architectures](https://github.com/josecyn/dl/tree/master/Coursera/dl/Course5%20-%20RNN):

In the RNN part of the course I created a RNN from scratch and a character-wise text generator.
Afterwards, there was a very interesting project on reducing bias in NLP.
On 3rd week we focused on attention and trigger word detection with application such as 'smart assistants'.
